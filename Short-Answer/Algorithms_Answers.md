#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
The time complexity of this is O(n) or linear because as the variable n increases, the runtime also increases at the same rate.

b)
Because of the nested for loop, the time complexity of this is O(n^2), and will work with smaller n values, but will take siginicantly more time as n grows in value.

c)
This algorithm is also O(n) because the runtime will increase proportionally to the value of n.

## Exercise II
